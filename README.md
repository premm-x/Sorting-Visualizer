# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a Sorting Visualizer that demonstrates the working of various sorting algorithms. It provides an interactive way to understand and visualize how different sorting techniques work.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented and visualized in this project:

1. **Bubble Sort**  
    Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

2. **Selection Sort**  
    Selection Sort divides the list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

3. **Insertion Sort**  
    Insertion Sort builds the sorted list one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part.

4. **Merge Sort**  
    Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

5. **Quick Sort**  
    Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a pivot element to partition the list into two sublists. The elements smaller than the pivot go to one sublist, and the elements larger go to the other. It then recursively sorts the sublists.

6. **Heap Sort**  
    Heap Sort uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements. It repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until all elements are sorted.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of sorting algorithms.
- Details of each algorithm.
- Adjustable speed and size of the array for visualization.

This project is a great tool for learning and understanding sorting algorithms in a visual and engaging way.
